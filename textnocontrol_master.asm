Blue Magic  Learning                 Blue magic is the art of learning monsters' special techniques.However, to learn them you'll need toset the blue mage ability Learning, andthen get hit by the enemy attack.Only then can you remember it and use itagainst others.To use the technique, use the blue mage ability Blue Magic.You can learn attacks like a goblin's Goblin Punch, a steel bat's Vampire,or a moldwynd's Aero!"
