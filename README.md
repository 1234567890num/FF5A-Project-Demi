# FF5A-Project-Demi
Holding repository for the ground-level work on a GBA version of Project Demi.

TODO:
1) Identify the IDs of all events for story cutscenes and dialogue.
2) Remove them.
3) Implement Project Demi's quality-of-life changes (run speed, encounter toggle, etc.)
4) Implement Fiesta Mod changes (Cactuar NED is mandatory)
5) If we can implement a "rare encounter only" toggle to save the user from having to quicksave repeatedly, that actually might be a great idea.
6) ...if we haven't lost interest yet, let's port Ancient Cave too, I'm mostly joking
