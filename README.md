# FF5A-Project-Demi
Holding repository for the ground-level work on a GBA version of Project Demi.

TODO:
1) Identify the IDs of all events for story cutscenes and dialogue.
2) Remove them.
3) Implement Project Demi's quality-of-life changes (run speed, encounter toggle, etc.)
4) Implement Fiesta Mod changes (Cactuar NED is mandatory)
5) ...if we haven't lost interest yet, let's port Ancient Cave too, I'm mostly joking
